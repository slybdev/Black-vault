# 👨‍💻 Silas Binitie – Cybersecurity Engineer | Threat Hunter | Blue Team Automation

## 🔹 Summary

Motivated cybersecurity engineer with a strong passion for threat detection, blue team tooling, and incident response. I specialize in automating security operations using Python and building offline, AI-enhanced tools for real-time defense. From log analysis to malware detection, I bridge the gap between security and code.

I’ve architected projects like **BlackVault** – an all-in-one SOC toolkit with AI detection engines, dashboards, phishing and malware classifiers, and a custom LLM assistant – all designed to run fully offline.
